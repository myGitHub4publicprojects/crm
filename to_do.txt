documentation:
	when collecting ha and ha invoice is not set first add the invoice
	when patient was created in crm (not via noach file import) and date of birth, first and last name are in crm - when importing the same patient from noach, audiograms from noach will be imported as well as phone number and noach ID and noach create date
	audiograms are displayed when online

Notes:
restriction - use only one Noach database - when importing from noach file (xml), noach patient ID is used and it is assumed it's unique
mistake - code was written before any tests
one app with many founctions
django stores datetime using timezones - datetime stored may be different that one provided from string, removed USE_TZ = True from settings.py
to display audiogram you need internet access - uses google charts
noach import - first patient from the file is ok but next was duplicated - removal from to_be_created list was not working due to incorrect itteration:
	for i in to_be_created2:
		if i['noahpatientid'] in remove_list:
			to_be_created.remove(i)		# DO NOT ITEREATE OVER THE SEQUENCE FROM WHICH YOU WANT TO REMOVE ITEMS!
