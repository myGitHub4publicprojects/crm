	add success message after adding a patient to database
	move messages to separate file and use {% inclue messages_display.html %}
	add success message after editing patient
	when editing date of birth is not prepopulated - display it as string, make it not required, if change needed display hidden widget

	add delete view, delete confirmation message

	hearing aid should be a separate class with atributes such as: make, model, family, date of sale, last fitting...

	instead of saving after editing each atribute do this for update view:
	product.name = 'Name changed again'
	product.save(update_fields=['name'])

	add text field to model - for new notes, each note to be saved with its date and time - customer interactions history, and who made the note - new field - audiologist - done as a seperate class with a foreign field
edit.html - if ear not selected but other ha fields compleated error

in detail view display clearly notes about patient and in second column history of notes in reverse chronological order

just before "create patient" in create.html add radio input - select audiometrist who created this patient

	in update template add radio input just next to "update" button to select who made changes, or maby only if a new note is added add date and audiometrist

	make template inheritance

next visit date, remider, calendar intergration

make dynamic ha selection in html, dict with ha already in edit view, use js, for now a temporary solution: ha_name as a Charfield and user types the name

index.html - display list of patient ordered by last name...
index - list of patient as a table, add buttons to order by: name, date etc.
add search field

new field on update - date and subject of incoming schaduled appiointment

in create.html change input fields - put desription text inside form fields, move "create" button down


in edit.html in hearing aid selection make them choose make family and model - now they can send only make
